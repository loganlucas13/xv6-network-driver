# xv6 Network Driver

## Overview

This project extends the xv6 operating system by implementing a device driver for a Network Interface Card (NIC) and the receive half of an Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack.

Goal: Downloading a web page from the internet from the xv6 operating system!

## Usage

For testing that the implementation works as expected, follow the instructions from this website. Do note that this implementation is NOT on RISC-V (x86 64 arch instead) and the tcp dump option mentioned in the site is not working yet.
